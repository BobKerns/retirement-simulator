# Contributing

This project is presently early stage, and focused on personal needs,
but if it can benefit others, that would be great!

Contributions are always welcome.

You can submit suggestions or ask questions via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/BobKerns/retirement-simulator/issues).

Clone this repository and the `retirement-data` repository for your data (do not push your data back to GitHub!)
Create a pull request with your changes. It is best if your submission is broken into a series of commits that each
do one thing, at the level of fix one bug or add one feature.

You can use `git rebase -i` to clean up your commit history to make it easier to follow, but do not feel obligated
to collapse it all down to one commit. You do not need to rebase onto the latest branch, you should merge in the latest
and ensure it builds, tests, and works before submitting.
