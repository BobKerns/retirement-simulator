<h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>
<p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our

diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>
<h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>
<h3 id="personal-data">Personal data</h3>
<p>For your own safety, please take care to not inject any personal data, especially
financial data into the project, or any clone of it. Such mistakes cannot be undone,
only mitigated. The project is designedto maintain a complete separation between tool
and personal data. Anything that diminishes that will be rejected.</p>

<li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
<li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
and learning from the experience</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
overall community</li>

<h2 id="enforcement-responsibilities">Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.</p>
<p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to me at <a href=mailto:&#x72;&#x77;&#x6b;&#x40;&#97;&#99;&#109;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#x67; >&#x72;&#x77;&#x6b;&#x40;&#97;&#99;&#109;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#x67;</a>.</p>
